percolation
===========

This is a library of C++ documents for simulating critical site percolation on the square lattice in 2 dimensions,
and for doing some stats on it. The simulation creates an N-by-N grid and opens sites at random until there is a path
of open sites from the top row of the grid to the bottom row. To compile, use the makefile (type make into the terminal).
